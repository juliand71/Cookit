Got all of the CRUD functions centered around Recipe working now. Next I'm going to add some styling so it's not so damn boring to look at all the time.

I originally was building this with the MVC template, I decided to switch to Razor Pages as I felt it offered more flexibility. I got a basic app working where you can view and create a Recipe today.
